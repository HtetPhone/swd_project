# swd_project
This is my project for SWD class and I did it for the final task of course completion.
First thing first, the design idea is from somebody's work but the whole code work is deadass 100% my work.
I used SASS to manage and design css more efficiently like declaring variables and stuffs.
Creating seperate scss files and importing under one single file, which lead to clean and maintainable code structures.

Here are the NPM depedecies I used
#bootstrap 5.2.2,  
#node-sass 7.0.3,
#slick-carousel 1.8.1,
#tilt-js 1.2.1 &
wow.js 1.2.2.

I also gotta put Some others design tools and stuffs like
#canva for my site logo
#random free illustration websites like freepiks etc
#loader generator such as loader.io?? i think..

As a special work that I did right up in the project isss..
Since this project is multi-pages site, on the mobile and tablet screens, we gon' get a navbar along, which I enabled it on the scroll up but hide 
on the scroll down. and many other works.....
